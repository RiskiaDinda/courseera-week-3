                                Gudeg is Yogyakarta’s special food, 
                                so tourists can find it easily during the visit. 
                                This also explains why people call it the City of Gudeg. 
                                Visitors or tourists can get the food either at local 
                                eateries or restaurants. Some places are famous enough 
                                and have been recognized even by foreigners, in fact. 
                                These include Yu Djum, Hj Ahmad, Narni, and much more. 
                                People don’t even need to get the help of a local 
                                guide to find the location. Lots of local people also 
                                sell Gudeg on the roadside and other strategic places. 
                                For the information, it is best to get the food in the morning 
                                where many local sellers operate. <br><br>

                                Before hunting this unique traditional food, 
                                tourists must know several types of it first. 
                                Commonly, there are three types. The first one is called Gudeg Kering 
                                or the dry one. The dressing is denser and the jackfruit is darker. 
                                The second one is called Gudeg Basah or the wet one. 
                                The dressing is less dense and the jackfruit is paler. 
                                Another one is called Gudeg Solo that comes with a white dressing. 
                                All of the types come with similar side dishes including the rice, though. 
                                Not to mention it comes with spicy krecek

                                Rendang is a Minang dish originating from the Minangkabau 
                                region in West Sumatra, Indonesia. It has spread across Indonesian cuisine 
                                to the cuisines of neighbouring Southeast Asian countries such as Malaysia, 
                                Singapore, Brunei and the Philippines. Rendang is often described as a 
                                rich dish of meat — most commonly beef (rendang daging) — that has been 
                                slow cooked and braised in a coconut milk seasoned with a herb and spice 
                                mixture,[6][7] until the liquids evaporate and the meat turns dark brown 
                                and tender, becoming caramelized and infused with rich flavours. <br><br>

                                As the signature dish of Minangkabau culture, 
                                rendang is traditionally served at ceremonial occasions to honour guests 
                                during festive events; such as wedding feasts and Hari Raya (Eid al-Fitr).
                                Rendang is also traditionally served among the Malay community in Indonesia, 
                                Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei, as well as the Maranao in the Philippines. <br><br>

                                Rendang is officially recognised as one of Indonesia's national dishes. 
                                Six types of rendang preparations have also been designated as intangible 
                                cultural heritage by the Indonesian Ministry of Education and Culture.

                            Rawon is the famous traditional dish from East Java province which totally different 
                            (for its appearance) with other dish in Indonesia. Generally, this dish can be 
                            categorized as a soup and furthermore, it is an extreme soup. 
                            Have you ever seen a black soup before? This one is as black as your 
                            wildest travel fantasy and here is the story for you. <br><br>

                            Not like other soup, rawon offers rich ingredients and extreme appearence. 
                            Well, maybe some people will doubt about its taste when they focus to its color 
                            (which is black). The goodnews is something nice swarming under the black surface 
                            of the soup. Yes, most of Rawon enriched with fresh beef meat which cutted into 
                            a small shape (similar to a dice). Served along with rice plus another side-dish 
                            such as salty egg, prawn crackers and chili sauce makes Rawon a perfect dish 
                            either for breakfast, lunch or dinner.
